/** `INKHandler` is the base class for shared groups of behavior for a class of third-party applications. You cannot use the `INKHandler` class directly. It instead defines the common interface and behavioral structure for all its subclasses.

 ## Subclassing Notes

 If you are defining URL schemes for a new discrete class of third-party applications (such as "web browsers" or "mapping applications", you may want to create your own `INKHandler` subclass. All custom methods you create that perform actions should ultimately return a UIActivityController created by calling performCommand:withArguments:. */
