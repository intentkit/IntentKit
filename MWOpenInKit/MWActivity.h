/** A subclass of `UIActivity` that presents a single third-party application capable of opening a given URL scheme or set of URL schemes.
 
 Typically, the dictionary of accepted URL schemes and the name of the application should come from the contents of a plist file and its filename, respetively. In practice, you shouldn't need to manually initialize an `MWActivity` outside of the `MWHandler` class.
 
 @warning `MWActivity`'s implementation of the `UIActivity` method `canPerformWithActivityItems:` always returns `YES`. It is your responsibility to ensure that an MWActivity can actually respond to a URL (using `canPerformCommand:withArguments:`) before adding it to a `UIActivityViewController`
 
 @warning `MWActivity` currently makes use of the private method `_activityImage` to coax the `UIActivityViewController` into displaying a full-color image rather than creating a black-and-white representation using the `UIImage` returned by `activityImage` as a mask. It remains to be seen whether Apple will allow this private API usage or not. */
